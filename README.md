# TaskPad
A Simple Django CRUD Task Pad for everyday use to keep up with tasks that just need to get done.

This Project utilizes one of the simplest yet powerful features of Software Developement and thats CRUD Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete.
No matter how far App developement goes one of the most important features for a Web App or App is to allow your users to be able to 
create a post whether that is for a Social network or a popular blog site. Many of todays most used Apps like Instagram are perfect examples
of CRUD a user takes a picture then posts it and if does not like it can delete the picture. The only difference is how sophisticated do you
want your CRUD Web App, App to be.
In this Web App I utilized CRUD by allowing a User to be able to create a Task, Retrieve the Task, Update the Task if needed and the ability
to Delete the Task if the User wishes. Sometimes keeping Web Apps simple is important because most of the population is not obsessed in being
a Tech genius they just need a tool that works and makes there life easier as they go through life.
